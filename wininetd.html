<p align="left"><b><i>WinInetd</i></b> is a simple Windows service that offers
the same (almost the same) functionalities that the Unix daemon <b><i>inetd</i></b>
offers. The power of the Unix <b><i>inetd</i></b> is that it makes very simple
for the developer to write network servers, since the server itself will do all
its I/O through the standard input/output. This also makes it very easy to write
portable network servers due to the complete absence inside the code of the
networking code that usually is great part of the server core code. Both <b><i>inetd</i></b>
and <b><i>WinInetd</i></b> are very simple and yet powerful. They read a
configuration file that basically maps local TCP/IP ports to executable binary
images and they listen on the user configured ports waiting for client
connections. Once a connection is received they create the process linked to the
connection port and they bind the connection socket to the standard
input/output/error of the new process. The configuration file gives also the
option to run the new process with the context of a user different from the one
the service/daemon is currently running. This helps isolate the new process by
giving a way to reduce the new process permissions and hence increase the
security of the system. The server, by default,&nbsp; reads a configuration file
named <i><b>wininetd.conf</b></i> inside the Windows directory but the command
line option <i><b>--cfgfile</b></i> can be used to force the default value. The
configuration file is very simple and it is composed by multiple lines following
this format :</p>
<p align="left"><b>PORT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USER:PASS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CMDLINE</b></p>
<p align="left">Where <b>PORT</b> is the port number the server has to listen
for incoming connections, <b>USER:PASS</b> is the username and password
separated by a colon ( : ) character and <b>CMDLINE</b> is the path of the
binary image to be executed and its command line parameters. It is possible to
not specify any user (and hence having the new process to run with the service
user credentials) by specifying <b>none</b> as <b>USER:PASS</b>. The user
specified (if present) as owner of the new process must have batch logon
capabilities to have <b><i>WinInetd</i></b> to successfully call <i>LogonUser</i>()
(it is possible to set the logon batch capability through the security policy
editor available among the Administrator tools). Example of valid configuration
lines are :</p>
<p align="left">10002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; davide:DamnYou&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe<br>
10123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; none&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\echo\echocs.exe
-d -c 156</p>
<p align="left">Every line that does not start with a digit is considered a
comment, and either space or tab are valid separators between configuration line
values. To install the service you can run :</p>
<p align="left"><i>wininetd --install</i></p>
<p align="left">from a MS-DOS prompt of a user that have service manipulation
rights. On the contrary, to remove the service, you can run :</p>
<p align="left"><i>wininetd --remove</i></p>
<p align="left">Changes to the configuration file will become effective only
when the server is restarted. It is also possible to run the service in debug
mode by running :</p>
<p align="left"><i>wininetd --debug ...</i><br>
<br>
from a MS-DOS prompt. The service also accept a few extra command line
parameters that you will be able to set through the Windows service management
console :</p>
<p align="left"><i>--cfgfile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= Sets the configuration file path<br>
<i>--timeout nsecs</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = Sets the default socket
timeout in seconds<br>
--linger-timeout nsecs = Sets the socket close linger timeout (default 60)<br>
<br>
It is possible to examine log messages that <b><i>WinInetd</i></b> produces
either through the MS-DOS prompt (when running in debug mode, see above) or
through the Windows Event Viewer. The program that will be run by <b><i>WinInetd</i></b>
will find a few environment variables set to help recognizing the client
connection :</p>
<p align="left"><i>CLIENT_IP</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= Client IP address<br>
<i>CLIENT_PORT</i>&nbsp; = Client PORT value</p>
